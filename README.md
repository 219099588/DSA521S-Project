# DSA521S-Project
This is a DSA521S Group Assignment Project.
You have to create a music player.

PROJECT SUMMERY 

A Namibian music start-up is looking for an efficient music player algorithm for a mobile application. Suppose 
you have 100 tracks on your list. The playlist works on the concept of linked list. Tracks are played one by 
one (best example of singly linked list. Track are connected and you can move from track four to five but you 
cannot go back.
1. Implement functionality to play tracks in both directions (following the behaviour of double linked list).
2. In addition, add the functionality to allow for the playing of tracks on repeat (circular).
3. Implement the functionality to add and remove tracks from playlist
4. The application should also allow for searches on playlist. E.g a user could search for a specific 
track 
Using ideas from class, design an algorithm to implement the functionalities described in the project 
summary. As far as possible, design and specify different modules/functions that make up the application.

PLEASE NOTE: All contributers are new to Github, most of the work, sharing of data and discussions took place on Watsapp and Ms Teams, and what was generated was later added to Github.
